# Titanic EDA Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze the survival of passengers. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations to understand the patterns and insights.

## Task Outline
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant features, and convert categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply feature scaling, handle outliers, and label encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
  - Visualize survival counts using a bar chart.
  - Explore age distribution with a histogram.
  - Understand correlations with a heatmap.

## Insights
- **Survival Count**: The majority of passengers did not survive, but a significant proportion did.
- **Age Distribution**: Most passengers were in their 20s and 30s.
- **Correlation**: Fare is positively correlated with survival, while lower-class passengers had lower survival chances.

## Files
- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
