# EDA and Visualization of Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations for the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover insights regarding passenger survival, demographics, and other key variables.

## Files
- `Task_1 Eda & visulization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA steps and visualizations.
- `titanic_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## Steps Taken:
### 1. Data Cleaning:
- Missing values were handled by filling with medians and modes.
- Irrelevant features were dropped.
- Categorical features were encoded numerically.

### 2. Visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Visualized survival counts of passengers.
- **Histogram**: Displayed the age distribution of passengers.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identified relationships between numerical variables.

## Insights
- Most passengers were young adults, with fewer children and older adults.
- A higher fare was associated with a higher survival rate.
- Females had a better survival rate than males.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`.
3. Run the notebook `Task_1 Eda & visulization.ipynb`.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization and analysis in understanding passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The notebook contains all steps, from data cleaning to visualization.
